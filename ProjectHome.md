MTADiag is a console-based application which will:
  * Read MTA's and GTA's install paths, and MTA's current version - if multiple versions of MTA are installed, it will ask the user to pick one to diagnose
  * Automatically download and launch MTA's latest nightly or unstable installer (whichever is applicable)
  * Verify GTA:SA installation files for missing or nonstandard files
  * Automatically remove compatibility mode entries which may interfere with MTA's launch
  * Check if DirectX is up-to-date, and if not, download and launch the web updater
  * Automatically generate a dxdiag log
  * Create a log file with the aforementioned paths, MTA's previous and updated version strings, the generated dxdiag log, a list of currently running processes, the contents of CEGUI.log, core.log, and logfile.txt, directory listings of the MTA, GTA, and GTA\models folders, and some other relevant information, which is then automatically uploaded to [MTA's PasteBin](http://pastebin.mtasa.com/).
MTADiag supports Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas 1.1.x and newer. Multi Theft Auto can be found at [www.mtasa.com](https://www.mtasa.com/).
